This repository is a basis of mvc in oop programming with functions 
that I find myself usually copying from one project to another, so I
 decided to make a new basis.  
 Do not forget when you take it, 
 to add the private.yml in the .gitignore, and to change its value with your settings.

# title of your repo

This repository contains the code for _**change it by the name of your project**_  
This project is about _**short description here!**_

More seriously, to use this repository, do not forget to install composer. (The **doc** is available [here](https://getcomposer.org/))  
and to run the command
>composer install  

or 
>php composer.phar install

(depending of whether you installed it locally or ,globally.)

afterward, do not forget to include a private.yml file with the following lines in it (and yes, the .sql file is still 
not online, but he shall come afterwards.)
>db_config:  
     name: _your db name_  
     host: _your host_  
     user: _the username to connect to your db_  
     pass: _the password of your db_

Finally, create an _access.log_ AND a _security.log_ file in the logs directory.

It was made by _**list of the person participating in the project 
(I let myself in since it is for private use)**_ and _Jonathan SIMONNEY_. Please contact 
one of us at _**same as precedent!**_ or 
_jonathan.simonney@supinternet.fr_ if you experiment any problem with this repository.
